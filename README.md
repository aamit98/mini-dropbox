See [`SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md`](./SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md) for detailed security improvements.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+ (JDK)
- Maven 3.6+
- Node.js 16+ and npm

### Starting the Application

**Important**: There are two different servers:
- **`rest-server/`** - Spring Boot REST API (for the web UI) - Use `mvn spring-boot:run`
- **`server/`** - TFTP Server (traditional protocol) - Use `mvn exec:java`

1. **Start REST Server** (port 8080) - **This is what you need for the web UI**:
   ```powershell
   cd rest-server
   .\run-server.ps1
   ```

2. **Start UI** (port 5173):
   ```powershell
   cd ui
   npm install
   .\run-ui.ps1
   ```

3. **Or start everything at once**:
   ```powershell
   .\start-all.ps1
   ```

### Access the Application

- Web UI: http://localhost:5173
- REST API: http://localhost:8080/api
- H2 Console: http://localhost:8080/h2-console (credentials in application.properties)

### Login Instructions

**Default Admin Account** (automatically created on first run):
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin`

**Or create your own account:**
1. Enter any username and password
2. Click "Register" to create a new account
3. Then click "Sign In" to login

> **Note**: The admin account is automatically created when the REST server starts for the first time. After that, you can use it or create new accounts.

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user (with validation)
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login and get JWT token
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user info

### File Management (v2 API)
- `GET /api/v2/files` - List user's files
- `POST /api/v2/files/upload` - Upload file (multipart/form-data)
- `GET /api/v2/files/{filename}` - Download file
- `DELETE /api/v2/files/{filename}` - Soft delete file
- `POST /api/v2/files/{filename}/undelete` - Restore deleted file

### Versioning
- `GET /api/v2/files/{filename}/versions` - List all versions
- `POST /api/v2/files/{filename}/restore?version={n}` - Restore specific version

### Sharing
- `POST /api/v2/files/{filename}/share` - Create shareable link
  - Body: `{ "hours": 24, "maxDownloads": 10 }`
  - Returns: `{ "code": "abc123", "url": "/d/abc123" }`
- `GET /d/{code}` - Download via share link (public)

## Development

### Building

```powershell
# Build all Maven modules
mvn clean install

# Build UI
cd ui
npm install
npm run build
```

### Running TFTP Server/Client

```powershell
# Start TFTP server (port 7777)
cd server
.\run-server.ps1

# Run TFTP client
cd client\tftp-client
.\run-client.ps1
```

## Configuration

Storage directory can be configured via environment variable:
```powershell
$env:STORAGE_DIR = "C:\path\to\storage"
```

Or edit `rest-server/src/main/resources/application.properties`
